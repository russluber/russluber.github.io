[Data science](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) undergrad at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) interested in causal inference, Bayesian statistics, forecasting, and game theory. Not necessarily in that order. Well, actually, maybe.

In my free time, I love:
- Going on walks
- Reading books
- Listening to podcasts
- Learning how to box

My intellectual first love was psychology. But I found myself more curious about the methods sections of the papers I was reading than the actual papers themselves. That's when I discovered my love for statistics. Since then, I've broadened my horizons and pivoted to data science. 

I'm currently shoring up my mathematical foundations with [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/). No two ways about it. I'm gonna get good at math.
