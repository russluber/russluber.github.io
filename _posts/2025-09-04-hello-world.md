Trying out this blogging thing. Not sure how it all works.

But I'm just gonna write.[^1] 

I guess this is my `hello world` for the blog.

The plan is for this blog to be a repo for my distilled thoughts. Well, maybe not *distilled* distilled. 

**Considered** thoughts, at the very least. No rants. No AI slop either. 

Just me and my thoughts. Original thoughts? I hope so.

This is gonna be great.

Or so I'm told. By my brain.

[^1]: For the hell of it. But also to practice writing. Footnotes are neat, yeah?
